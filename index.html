              <p class="bodytext">
                If the last 20 years have shown us anything, it’s that trying to
                prepare for the future is a fool’s errand. We can only see so
                far.<br />‍<br />We (meaning businesses, organizations and
                everyone in-between) think technology causes change. It doesn’t.
                Instead, change is driven by how people use technology - often
                in different or unexpected ways.<br />‍<br />Because we scramble
                to predict the future, we miss that story. We focus on what we
                think will happen, rather than what our customers are actually
                doing. So we invest millions in products and features that we
                honestly think will work...and no one uses them.<br />‍<br />But
                if we just stop listening to the story we tell ourselves for a
                few seconds, and start listening to our customers instead,
                they’ll tell you everything you need to know.

                We live in our own ecosystems. Social media, remote working,
                terabytes of data. All great. All challenges. As organizations
                become used to new technology and trends like flexible working,
                we become splintered. There’s a reason why you can find dozens
                of articles about breaking down information silos. It’s a
                problem we’ve never had before at this scale.<br /><br />If your
                business has teams all across the country - the world - how can
                you hope to hold each other accountable, explore and interrogate
                ideas, and question each other in vigorous debate?<br /><br />And
                if you can’t get the team on the same page, how can you expect
                to follow the customer? <br /><br />Unless, of course, you find
                a way to do just that.

                An Experience Map is a visual representation of a customer’s
                literal experience with your business. It’s a physical map that
                shows what the customer does, what they feel, and what they
                think along every step of the way. From the moment they see an
                advertisement, to when they take up a free trial, all the way to
                chatting with customer support with a problem and beyond.

                The good news is, you don’t have to know what’s coming. You
                never will. Instead, you just need to be completely focused on
                one thing: your customer.<br /><br />By tying yourself to your
                customer’s decision making process, their complete end-to-end
                experience, and by understanding the psychology behind their
                activity, you’ll make customer-centric decisions instead of
                being driven by technology trends. <br /><br />That’s where an
                Experience Map comes in. <br /><br />Informed by data,
                decision-makers across the business, the people who deal with
                customers everyday and the customers themselves, is about
                identifying what your customers are doing, thinking and feeling
                right now and prioritizing opportunities to improve their
                experience in the future.<br /><br />
                It’s the proverbial canary in the coal mine. Using an Experience

                Typically, Experience Maps are kept focused on a specific
                experience or project. It just makes them easier to create by
                limiting the number of people involved, the time you need to
                dedicate, and the complexity of including multiple data points
                and voices in the room (we’ll get to “the room” soon).
                <br /><br />But you can make your Experience Map as focused or
                as holistic as you want. You can create Experience Maps for:

                  The best and most comprehensive way to create your Experience
                  Map is with a workshop, bringing together all the relevant
                  voices and data in a single room. This event requires some
                  planning to make sure everything stays on track, so you’ll
                  need to decide on several things first:
                </p>
              </div>
              <h3>Scope</h3>
              <p class="bodytext">
                Like we just described - what are you measuring in your
                Experience Map? Once you agree on that, that will help you
                decide what voices need to be heard. Experience Maps are
                cross-disciplinary, so you need to determine who should be
                there. Colleagues at every level should be there.
                <br /><br />Remote working shouldn’t be a barrier to getting the
                right people in the room. Think about the technology your
                attendees have access to, and start thinking about ways to help
                facilitate their access.
              </p>
              <h3 class="h3">What data do you need?</h3>
              <p class="bodytext prelist">
                Creating an Experience Map relies on more than opinions and
                subjective anecdotes. You need facts, too. Bring together
                elements like:
              </p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li class="list-item">    <span>&rarr;</span> User stories</li>
                <li class="list-item">    <span>&rarr;</span> Calls</li>
                <li class="list-item">    <span>&rarr;</span> In-product tracking and usage</li>
                <li class="list-item">    <span>&rarr;</span> A/B test results</li>
                <li class="list-item">    <span>&rarr;</span> Analytics</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="bodytext">
                This is typically an all-day workshop, even for a specific
                project. So the more people you get on board, the more material
                you gain, the better experience you’ll have.
